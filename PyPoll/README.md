PyPoll Challenge
I want to thank the tutor (David Pecot) that helped me better understand how to use Dictionary list.  For Loops will take me quite a while to undrstand.

Pypoll
The question posed was pull the Election Data Results out of the file: elections_data.csv
From there a dictionary list of candidates was created
Once the data was read a For Loop was created to pull all Candidates in the file.
Another For Loop was created to capture the total vote per candidate.
Once those 2 main pieces were generated, the votes had to give a total count and also a percentage of how many votes from the total votes did each candidate receive.
